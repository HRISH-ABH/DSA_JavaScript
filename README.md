# 🧠 DSA Practice in JavaScript

This repository is my personal collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems solved using **JavaScript**. It helps me revisit and revise problems anytime with structured and readable solutions.

## 📌 About

This repo includes solutions from:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

Each file contains a clean implementation of the problem with meaningful variable names and logic, and comments where needed.
